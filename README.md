## Space Engineers Mod Toolkit for Blender ##

This is a [Blender](http://blender.org) 2.71 template with embedded scripts for creating mods
for the game [Space Engineers](http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/).
It's a community project and not affiliated with the game developers.

### The Guide ###

You can learn more about it by reading [the guide on Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=317209726). This is not yet
suitable for those completely new to Space Engineers mods. It assumes some knowledge of how modding works in the game. Once more features
are fully implemented, I'll write a modding tutorial and maybe do some videos.

### Downloads ###

Download links are also in the guide. You're strongly advised to read the guide because some things are not completely obvious.

* [SEMT Release Version](https://github.com/rjstone/SEMT/blob/stable/SpaceEngineersModToolkit.blend?raw=true) - Only has features tested to work.
  The guide should be up-to-date with this version.
* [SEMT Development Version](https://github.com/rjstone/SEMT/blob/master/SpaceEngineersModToolkit.blend?raw=true) - Contains things
  pretty much the minute I add them, possibly with no testing at all. If you want to help test, check out the
  [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/rjstone/SEMT/issues)
  for things marked as "needs testing", then either comment in the issue or on the discussion thread (see below).
  The guide will probably not document anything new in here.

### The Discussion Thread ###
