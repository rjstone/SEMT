{"name":"SEMT","tagline":"Space Engineers Mod Toolkit for Blender","body":"## Space Engineers Mod Toolkit for Blender ##\r\n\r\nThis is a [Blender](http://blender.org) 2.71 template with embedded scripts for creating mods\r\nfor the game [Space Engineers](http://www.spaceengineersgame.com/).\r\nIt's a community project and not affiliated with the game developers.\r\n\r\n### The Guide ###\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about it by reading [the guide on Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=317209726). This is not yet\r\nsuitable for those completely new to Space Engineers mods. It assumes some knowledge of how modding works in the game. Once more features\r\nare fully implemented, I'll write a modding tutorial and maybe do some videos.\r\n\r\n### Downloads ###\r\n\r\nDownload links are also in the guide. You're strongly advised to read the guide because some things are not completely obvious.\r\n\r\n* [SEMT Release Version](https://github.com/rjstone/SEMT/blob/stable/SpaceEngineersModToolkit.blend?raw=true) - Only has features tested to work.\r\n  The guide should be up-to-date with this version.\r\n* [SEMT Development Version](https://github.com/rjstone/SEMT/blob/master/SpaceEngineersModToolkit.blend?raw=true) - Contains things\r\n  pretty much the minute I add them, possibly with no testing at all. If you want to help test, check out the\r\n  [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/rjstone/SEMT/issues)\r\n  for things marked as \"needs testing\", then either comment in the issue or on the discussion thread (see below).\r\n  The guide will probably not document anything new in here.\r\n\r\n### The Discussion Thread ###\r\n\r\nYou may also wish to take a look at or comment on\r\n[the discussion thread on the Keen Software House forums](http://forums.keenswh.com/post/space-engineers-mod-toolkit-for-blender-7090652)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
